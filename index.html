                <p>This dashboard uses interactive charts to display a data set on London road casualties between 2010-2014. Most of the charts can filtered to specific 
                data by clicking the sections that display data, this will show across all the charts. For example if you click 'Female' in the first pie chart all the charts will show 
                only data for females. Or if you click Ealing on the bar chart you will only see the data for Ealing across all charts. If you click multiple sections you will 
                see combined data so if you had clicked Ealing and then Islington in the bar char you will see combined results across the charts.
                </p>
                <p>Please note: the first number display showing the number of incidents 2010-2014 will not change and the 2nd number display showing percentage
                of severe and fatal incidents are not clickable but will change when the charts are clicked to reflect that specific data set. Clicking the line chart will also not change the displays
                across other charts but the data on that chart itself will repond to clicking the other charts.

            acorss the UK with men accounting for 74% road traffic deaths and 70% of serious injuries according to the

              well has many businesses and offices. Many central areas are very busy most of the day and with so many pedestrians, cyclists and general
              road users trying to get somewhere, often in a hurry, it is no surprise accidents will happen.</p>
